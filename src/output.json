The battles that are waged in courts, as well as in cooperate and social dialog are frought with technical drawbacks. The question is, where is the best place to apply pressure to affect the most significant, persistent change?","context":"The economist approaches this subject in their article \"Behind Closed Doors\", where they essentially express dissapointment in the state of the promising \\#meToo movement.","substantiation":"The article addresses the many difficult fronts the movements faces. Legally, while the movement has spurred action in some states to review their laws, resistence from the supreme court and preexisting laws that limit employees ability to take cases of sexual harrasment to court presents a significant limit to the momentum of the cause (not to mention the recent, highly symbolic outcome of the Bret Kavanaugh nomination). Businesses face a complex web of incentives concerning the \\#metoo movement. While highly public brands may see PR opportunities in the the dialog, solving the issues requires a delicate navigation of appealing to fears of the preexisting male employees (significantly the senior hedgemnoy, built on an exclusive network of network of connections built on a mix of interpersoanl and professional trust) and the female employees, often in the unhelpful form of providing easier ways to make a cliam (which isn't nearly as hard as keeping your job afterward). Essantially, the firm's best play is to engage in the latest rhetorical homage while minimizing the risk of disrupting their current setup, by either hiring less wemon and settling lawsuites that happen to bubble up through the obstical course already in place. Essentially to do nothing.","analysis":"I think the best place to apply pressure is on the advertising business, as the as significant amount of the issues are result of accepted male culture. Ads will sell what people will buy. We can see this is the freshly minted \"feminist\" movies rolling out in greater numbers over the years. Culture is a cycle of supply and demand, and the industry will follow the money. It's a simple consumer choice for men. Creatives need to create the new male archetype which may be sold. Only then will the men feel like they have something to gain by modifying their behavior, which unfortunately, as with all humans, is the only likely way they will change.","conclusion":"The best pressure should be applied developing a new male archetype, especially if that character can be exhibited existing in the cooperate world. If the current culture is the problem, and the culture is male community and identity, then it must be changed. I propose that both the stick and carrot approach should be used, however the \\#metoo movement, which is acting as the stick, will run out of steam if it asssails the trenches of inextricably combined male and cooperate incentives without simultaneously creating a definition of male identity that can be used by males over other males for economic and emotional gain."}}}
