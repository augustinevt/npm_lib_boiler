Lack of financial education is making millenials poor. Why is this not working? Does anything else work? And That is that! Young people are never tought how to navigate the economic infrastructure setup, by no game of change, by the previous generation. Isn't that weird? 90% of assholes don't know what a 401 k is. As heathy miller says, only two millenials in the world are financially literate, and they are both trillionaires. Only the wealthier members of society are tought to leverage the framework we are all expected to function in. Therefore, it is no wonder that there is a sense of hopelessness. Millenials need to redefine the system they wish to eschew. However, we are underserved by lack of interest and/or knowledge of the objective financial context we inhabit.

therefore we must cahnge people are cool when they change 90% of people say that they like change! Isn't that fun? so do it! Yay!
